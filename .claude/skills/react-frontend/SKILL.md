# React Frontend Rules

This skill provides the authoritative rules for writing correct, idiomatic React code. See the detail files for full explanations and code examples:

- [purity-and-rendering.md](purity-and-rendering.md) — purity, idempotency, side effects, and immutability rules
- [rules-of-hooks.md](rules-of-hooks.md) — where and how Hooks can be called
- [react-calls-components.md](react-calls-components.md) — why React (not you) must call components and Hooks

## Quick Reference

### Components and Hooks must be pure
| Rule | Allowed | Not allowed |
|---|---|---|
| Idempotent render | Same output for same props/state/context | `new Date()`, `Math.random()` in render body |
| Side effects | Event handlers, `useEffect` | Network calls, DOM mutations, subscriptions in render |
| Props | Read-only | `props.x = newValue` |
| State | `setState(newValue)` | `state.x = newValue` |
| Hook arguments | Spread a copy: `{ ...arg }` | Direct mutation of Hook arguments |
| Hook return values | Treat as read-only | Mutating memoized return values |
| Post-JSX mutation | Derive new values before JSX | Mutating an object after passing it to JSX |

### Rules of Hooks
- Call Hooks **only at the top level** of a function component or custom Hook
- Call Hooks **only from React functions** (function components or custom Hooks)
- Never call Hooks inside: conditions, loops, nested functions, `try/catch`, event handlers, or class components

### React calls components and Hooks
- Use components in **JSX only** — never call `MyComponent()` directly
- Never pass a Hook as a prop or variable — always call it inline
- Never write higher-order Hooks that wrap other Hooks dynamically

## Key file locations in this project
- `src/pages/` — page-level components
- `src/components/` — shared and feature components
- `src/hooks/` — custom hooks (`useHoldings`, `useTransactions`, `useStaking`, `useToast`, …)
- `src/context/AppContext.tsx` — global React context
- `src/lib/` — pure utility functions (no hooks, no JSX)
